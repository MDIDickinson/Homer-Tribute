      Homer is the only nuclear safety engineer I know who is not certified.
      <br>
      In spite of not being certified he is responsible for only  a handful of accidents
      <br>
       He is always creating new ways to stay "awake" at work and this helps get the job done.
      <br>
       His boss, Mr. Burns, thinks he is doing a swell job.
